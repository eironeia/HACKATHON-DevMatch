# HACKATHON-DevMatch
First Steps
 
* Idea of the project

The idea of the project was create a social network, similar to Tinder to relationated all the people interested in hackathons or developer events, avoiding that you have to stay home because no one of your friends are interested on going. So this way we were interested on break the barreer of shy.

But hadn't finished the work so the project have issues.
